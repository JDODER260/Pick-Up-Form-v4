# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is the first version of our app built with Flutter/Dart. All previous versions were in a different repository with different technology stack.

| Version | Supported          | Notes                            |
| ------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| 4.0.x   | :white_check_mark: | Current Flutter/Dart version     |
| < 4.0   | :x:                | Different repository/tech stack  |

*Note: Version 4.0.0 represents our complete rewrite in Flutter/Dart. Previous versions (1.x-3.x) are maintained in a separate legacy repository.*

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**We take security seriously and appreciate your help in keeping our app secure.**

### How to Report
**DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead:

1. **Email**: jdswebsites@gmail.com *(replace with your actual security email)*
2. **Subject**: `[SECURITY] pick_up_app_v4 Vulnerability Report`
3. **Include**:
   - Affected version (e.g., "4.0.0")
   - Detailed steps to reproduce
   - Screenshots or videos if applicable
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Your contact information

### Response Timeline
- **Acknowledgement**: Within 1 week
- **Initial Assessment**: 1-5 weeks
- **Regular Updates**: Monthly until resolution
- **Fix Timeline**: Based on severity:

### Vulnerability Types We Address
- Authentication/authorization bypass
- Data leakage or exposure
- Code injection vulnerabilities
- Insecure data storage
- Privacy violations
- API security issues

### What We Don't Cover
- Feature requests
- UI/UX improvements
- Non-security bugs (use regular issues for these)
- Social engineering attacks requiring physical access
- Issues in dependencies (we'll forward to maintainers)

### Recognition
We credit security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities (unless they prefer anonymity).

### Safe Harbor
We won't take legal action against security researchers who:
- Make good faith efforts to avoid privacy violations
- Don't modify or delete data
- Give us reasonable time to fix issues
- Don't exploit vulnerabilities beyond proof-of-concept
